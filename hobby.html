                        <p class="hbydesc">I always start my day with some physical activities whenever I can. It's really beneficial to integrate this kind of activity especially for most people whose currently don't have any other activity which involves working out their physics. Plus it's a bonus that you can start your day earlier with such a spirit burning activity.</p>

                        <p class="hbydesc">Reading and discovering new things has been my new hobby, I believe it would be beneficial to expand our knowledge even broader. I don't necessarily read a lot of books I believe that information and knowledge can be gathered from literary anywhere, the challenge is really to apply the knowledge and be consistent with it for a long time.</p>

                        <p class="hbydesc">I sometimes call it a day by grooving, what kind of? it always depends on how the day has been going. For me music is really the best form of communication that human has ever created everyone understands a groove when they hear one, even without being limited by our language barrier.</p>
